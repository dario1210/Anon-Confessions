    A privacy-focused backend service that allows users to:
    • Post and manage anonymous confessions.
    • React to posts with likes or dislikes.
    • Leave comments on confessions.
    • Receive real-time updates through WebSocket.

    The API is designed with RESTful principles, uses SQLite for data storage, and ensures anonymity without storing personal information.
